<h1>Github</h1>
<p>This week I learned about Github, and how SourceTree plays a big part in Github. First you will create a Github account.
  you then create a new repository, named it the title of the project I am currently working on and then cloned the url on SourceTree. Before you actually started working on it you have to create a branch so all the work and progress I achieve on my project will be saved on that branch but that's after you commit which is like saving. Right after you commit you had to push the new information to the master. The master branch is also known as your storage branch, all your progress will be moved to the master branch. Right after you push you will go to your Github account and you will merge pull request. it will check if there are any conflicts, you then confirm and delete the branch from your github account because you that information has been moved to the master branch so you do not need an extra branch witht he information. That is a way to confuse yourself and miss track your branches and where you are working on. Note that the branch is deleted from you Github account but not SourceTree. You then go to your Git, you then will fetch. Fetching refers to getting the latest changes from an online repository without merging them in. Once these changes are fetched you can compare them to your local branches. Right after you you fetch you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date. Then you will delete your local branch from your Git.
